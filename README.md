## Political Neighbor

Starting with Oregon's US Representatives, Political Neighbor will make useful political and policy information available to Oregonians in one site.  

The long term goal of Political Neighbor is to reach past the rhetoric of politics, and instead present policy debates and decisions in a straightforward way that is personally applicable to voters.
